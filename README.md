  Note: Please ensure you have installed <code><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">nodejs</a></code>

  To preview and run the project on your device:
  1) Open project folder in <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Visual Studio Code</a>
  2) In the terminal, run `npm install`
  3) Run `npm start` to view project in browser

  4) Everything important is in the pages directory in src. This includes report, landing page, etc.. tsx files.
  5) URGENT FIX: Responsiveness of the site! Hoping to find a non-code solution where we can just deploy and vercel or something can make it more responsive. Right now resizing when shrinking or increasing size of window is causing lots of spacing issues.
  6) Fixes to make: Sizing of the screen (currently too zoomed in), Integration of maps as an adress bar input in place of the map picture, & Multiple choice functionality.
  7) Future problems to consider: Deployment? Integrating w/ backend model & API calls
